# About

Parametric chain of low profile links that have rotary connections. Parameters include overall dimensions, movement angle and more.

# Notes

Spent way too long divining a "fillet" circle on chain segment endcaps via geometric reasoning. Complete waste of time, never again. Helped along with a FreeCAD sketch included in this repo. Original was aiming to use ["variant links"](https://wiki.freecad.org/Variant_link), but it's not very elegant (that's funny to say considering the resulting OpenSCAD script).

RotorSpine 3 (Arcs) is the usable version, prior ones are junk made along the way.
